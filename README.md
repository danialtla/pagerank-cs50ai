Overview
This project implements the PageRank algorithm, originally used by Google Search to rank web pages in search engine results. The algorithm assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as web pages, with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set.

Features
Input: Adjacency matrix representing the link structure between pages.
Output: PageRank scores for each page.
Customizable Parameters:
Damping factor (default: 0.85)
Convergence threshold (default: 1e-6)
Maximum iterations (default: 100)

Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
